## **INTRODUCTION**

Tic Tac Toe is a game for two players, where there moves are based on two figures or characters i.e. "X" and "0" in a 3*3 space grid. The player who succeed in placing three respective marks of his choice in a horizontal,vertical, or diagonal row is declared as winner. This game is a pretty nice way to pass your free time
with your partner,friend etc as it requires two players.
